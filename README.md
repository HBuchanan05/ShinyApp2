# ShinyApp2
Shiny app for Motor Accidents data in Exploratory and Cloud Based Data Analysis at SDSU

The main goal of the app is to compare the time it takes to get an individual to the hospital.

Only a month filter and time difference filter is applied as various conditions for weather and roads can be infered and using only known accident times and hospital admission times lowers the number of elements in the data set from ~37 thousand to ~8 thousand. However, the app only uses 2023 data.
